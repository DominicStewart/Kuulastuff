You can determine when we last updated the Service by referring to the “Last Updated” legend at the top of these Terms. Except to the extent that your express consent to any revised Terms is required under data protection law, by continuing to access, browse or use the Service, you confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms and all the terms incorporated herein by reference. We strongly recommend that you periodically review these Terms. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, including any terms incorporated by reference, you may not access or use the Service.</p>

<p>By providing a credit card or other payment method that we accept, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the designated payment method and that you authorize us or our third party payment processor to charge your payment method for the total amount of your subscription or other purchase (including any applicable taxes and other charges) (collectively, as applicable, an “Order”).

<h2 id="medical-disclaimer">16. Medical Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Part of our Service facilitates access to and participation in fitness classes provided by third-party independent instructors. Kuula makes no representations about the credentials of any third-party instructors or their offerings, and the platform is not intended to be a vehicle for, or to replace, professional medical advice or treatment. Kuula takes no responsibility for content provided by third parties relating to health, fitness, and/or nutritional information, and your use of any information or advice conveyed through the Service is, as between you and Kuula, solely at your own risk.

<h2 id="arbitration-and-class-action-waiver">17.  ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h2>
<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH KUULA AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</p>
<p>YOU AND KUULA AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS, OR THE SERVICES SHALL BE FINALLY DECIDED BY BINDING ARBITRATION UNDER THE RULES OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION GOVERNING CONSUMER DISPUTES.</p>
<p>Arbitration uses a single, neutral arbitrator to decide a dispute (instead of a judge or jury); arbitration allows for more limited discovery than in a court case; and the arbitration process and result is subject to very limited review by courts. In an arbitration you have the right, at your expense, to be represented by an attorney of your choosing. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief under these Terms that a court can award under these Terms. You and Kuula agree that any in-person arbitral hearing would occur in the United States in the same county and state as your billing address. Kuula further agrees that your filing fee for an arbitration will be capped at the amount set by the American Arbitration Association. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Kuula are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms and the termination of your use of the services.</p>
<p>REGARDLESS OF THE FORUM, YOU AND KUULA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>
<p>Further, unless both you and KUULA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not join or consolidate more than one person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.</p>
<h2 id="modifications-to-the-service">18.  Modifications to the Service</h2>
<p>We reserve the right in our sole discretion to modify, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any features or portions thereof) at any time.</p>
<h2 id="termination">19.  Termination</h2>
<p>Notwithstanding anything contained in these Terms, we reserve the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to terminate your right to access or use the Service at any time and for any or no reason, and you acknowledge and agree that we shall have no liability or obligation to you in such event and that you will not be entitled to a refund of any amounts that you have already paid to us, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
<h2 id="governing-law-and-jurisdiction">20.  Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>These Terms and the transactions they contemplate, including without limitation their interpretation, construction, performance and enforcement shall be governed by the laws of the State of North Carolina, U.S.A., including its statutes of limitations, but without reference to conflict or choice of law provisions, as applicable to contracts made and performed entirely within such State. The International Convention on the Sale of Goods, and other international treaties that are not mandatory with respect to contracts made and performed entirely in North Carolina, shall not apply. Except as otherwise provided in Section 16, the exclusive forum for the resolution of any dispute relating to these Terms shall be in the state courts in North Carolina, U.S.A., within one hundred (100) miles of Raleigh, North Carolina, or the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, and each of the parties agrees to personal jurisdiction of such courts with regard to any dispute relating to these Terms, and you agree to service of process on you by e-mail to the address you have submitted on the Service, if any, and by any other means permitted by law.</p>

Any notices to you may be made via either email or postal mail to the address in Kuula’s records or via posting on the Service. Please report any violations of these Terms to Kuula at the contact listed above.</p>
<h2 id="severability">22.  Severability</h2>
<p>If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of these Terms.</p>
<h2 id="special-admonitions-for-international-use">23.  Special Admonitions for International Use</h2>
<p>All matters relating to the Service are governed exclusively by the laws of the State of North Carolina in the United States of America and not the jurisdiction in which you are located. If you are located outside of the United States of America and you contact us, please be advised that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States of America and that by submitting information, you explicitly authorize such transfer. We make no claims that the Service or any of its content is accessible or appropriate outside of the United States. If you access the Service from outside the United States, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws.</p>
<h2 id="survival">24. Survival</h2>
<p>All rights and obligations of you and Kuula under these Terms which by intent or meaning have validity beyond or by their nature apply or are to be performed or exercised after the termination or expiration of this Agreement shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for the period so specified, if any, or for perpetuity.</p>
