<p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past twelve (12) months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you: (a) the categories of personal information we collected about you; (b) the categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you; © our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information; (d) the categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information; (e) the specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request); and (f) if we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing (1) sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and (2) disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, or otherwise perform our contract with you.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>

<p><strong>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</strong></p>
<p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request through one of the Company’s contact methods listed in Section XII below. Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.</p>
<p>You may make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The request must: (a) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and (b) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</p>
<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>
<p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. If we find that your verifiable consumer request unless is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded, we may charge a fee to respond to it, and will provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</strong></p>
<p>If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the “right to opt-out”). Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time. To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@kuula.tv">support@kuula.tv</a>. Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@kuula.tv">support@kuula.tv</a>. You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Discrimination</strong></p>
<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not: (a) deny you goods or services; (b) charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties; © provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; or (d) suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</p>
<p>However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result  in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.</p>
